# Simple Elevator System (React + TS)

This is a simple elevator system simulation built with React and TypeScript.  
It simulates multiple elevators processing random floor requests in pseudo-realtime.

## Features

- Multiple elevators moving independently
- Random floor requests generated at intervals
- Basic request queuing and assignment logic
- Visual representation of elevator states and positions
